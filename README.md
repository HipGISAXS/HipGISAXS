## TO BUILD HIPGISAXS BINARY AND LIBRARY
To build the HipGISAXS application binary and static library, use `scons`. Make sure you are passing paths to all the dependencies through `--extrapath=` option of scons:

    $ scons --extrapath=<path1>,<path2>,<etc>

To enable GPU support, use `--with-cuda` option:

    $ scons --extrapath=<path1>,<path2>,<etc> --with-gpu

To enable MPI support, use `--with-mpi` option:

    $ scons --extrapath=<path1>,<path2>,<etc> --with-gpu --with-mpi

or,

    $ scons --extrapath=<path1>,<path2>,<etc> --with-mpi

The generated binary, `hipgisaxs`, will be located in the `bin` directory.
The generated static library, `libhipgisaxs.a`, will be located in the `lib` directory.

... and you are done. Go enjoy HipGISAXS!

NOTE: See Appendix at the end of this file for more detailed and customized building information.


## TO RUN HIPGISAXS
1. Make sure all the paths (data, output) and other variables are correctly set in the input HiG file.
2. Execute the binary with the input file as an argument. For example,  
   ```
   $ ./bin/hipgisaxs inputs/01-cylinder.hig
   ```


## INPUTS
The HipGISAXS binary takes as input a file in HiG format.
Please refer to detailed HipGISAXS documentation for details of the HiG format.
A few sample input files are located in the directory "inputs", with extensions ".hig".
Update the input file as needed. Detailed information on the inputs is available at https://webhipgisaxs.lbl.gov  
The main components in the input file to update are the following:

1. Shape name defines the input filename containing triangulated shape data.
   It should point to the correct location of the file (relative path):  
   ```
       ...
       shape = {
    	   ...
    	   name = "data/flexrod.obj"
       } ...
   ```
   This file needs to be either in HDF5 format or the OBJ format.  
   Some sample shape files are provided in the directory "data", with extensions ".hd5".

2. Output locatation needs to be defined as pathprefix and runname in the computation object:
   ```
      ...
      computation = {
    	  ...
    	  pathprefix = ".",
    	  runname = "myflexrod",
    	  ...
      } ...
   ```
   The `pathprefix` is a relative path to a directory.  
   The `runname` is appended with a timestamp, and a directory by this resulting name is created in the directory specified by `pathprefix`.  
   All output files are stored in this generated directory.  

3. Resolution alters the final image resolution, and also affects the run time:
   ```
      ...
      computation = {
    	  ...
    	  resolution = [ 1000 500 ],
    	  ...
      } ...
   ```
   Obviously, simulations with lower resolutions finish faster.  
   Modify the provided input file templates as needed.


## TO USE THE HIPGISAXS LIBRARY IN YOUR OWN APPLICATION
   Please refer to the examples provided in the `samples` directory.
   It contains simple code which uses the HipGISAXS library.
   The corresponsing Makefile is also provided as a reference.

   ```
      $ scons --extrapath=$PATHS_TO_SOFTWARE --with-mpi --with-cuda
   ```

4. On successful build, the binary will be generated in the `bin` directory, called `hipgisaxs`.

### B. [NERSC](http://www.nersc.gov) Systems

#### Edison (Cray XC30, Intel Ivy Bridge)
1. All required software, except `libtiff` are available as modules on Edison. An example set of modules you can load are given in the `build/modules.edison` file. You could just `source` this file:  
   ```
      $ source build/modules.edison
   ```

2. You will need to install `libtiff`. Please refer to the required software section above.
3. An example build command is given in the `build/build-edison.sh`. If needed, make sure the paths are correctly set, including your installation of `libtiff`. Since Edison requires cross compilation for its compute nodes, make sure the `CC` and `CXX` environment variables are also set. Example:  
   ```
      $ CC=cc CXX=CC scons --with-mpi --extrapath=$BOOST_ROOT,$TIFFDIR
   ```

1. All the required softwares are already available on these systems. If you want to use your own installation of any of the required softwares, make sure you use its corresponding paths in the following.
2. An example build command is given in the `build/build-bragg.sh` or `build/build-andromeda.sh`. If needed, make sure the paths are correctly set.
3. Once all the required software are available, use the `scons` command to build the binary. Example:  
    ```
      $ scons --extrapath=/usr/local/cuda --with-mpi --with-cuda
    ```

4. On successful build, the binary will be generated in the `bin` directory, called `hipgisaxs`.

## INSTALLING SOFTWARE DEPENDENCIES

### A. TIFF library

1. The source for the TIFF library can be obtained from http://remotesensing.org/libtiff.
2. Use the `configure` script to generate the required build files. C++ support should be enabled. Additionally, disable JPEG support unless you are willing to install JPEG libraries as well. Example:    
    ```
      $ ./configure --prefix=<my_install_path> --disable-zlib --disable-jpeg --enable-cxx
    ```
3. Compile the source with `make`:  
    ```
      $ make
    ```
